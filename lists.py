    - traversal
    '''
    # this next section demonstrates both access and traversal
    # write a for loop that prints out the elements of l2, each on a 
    # separate line.
    # DO NOT hard code the stop value - use len()
    # your code should use indexing
    # the line should contain the value of the index as well as the element
    # your code below here
    # repeat the loop but use l2 itself as the sequence. In this case index
    # values will not be available, so just print the elements
